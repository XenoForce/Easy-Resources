Easy Resources mod:

Please note: This mod is for the Serpulo planet, and Not for the Erekir planet.

**Features:**

* All ores (minerals) that can be mined, are softer, so that the drills work faster.

* The mechanical drill, and the pneumatic drill work faster, and can be used on all ores.

* The user-controlled core drones (worker drones) build faster.

* The default conveyor, and the titanium conveyor belts work faster.

* The item factories for silicon, metaglass, graphite, surge alloy, phase fabric, and plastanium work faster.

**Notes:**

Also see the "Cores Anywhere" mod, which is a Java mod.
